# 8-ball-game

This is a game uses Python to answer questions for you as if it were an actual magic 8-ball. Play and don't be afraid if it predicts the future!

# Author's Note:

This is not a fancy piece program. However, I did make sure when programming it that it doesn't break easy, try it! I broke the code up into two files, one for the controller and one for the repository where all the big stuff happens. I don't have comments, but the function names should be pretty self explanatory.
